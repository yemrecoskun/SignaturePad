We can provide assurance by recording (X and Y coordinates, pressure value applied to the screen, Time, Signature Id) information.

## Programs and Languages Used
- Xamarin Android
- C#
- Xaml

## Software Architecture and Principle
- We prepared the library used for the signature of the project. [Go to Library](https://github.com/yemrecoskun/SignaturePad/blob/master/SignaturePad/SignaturePad.cs)
- We call the Canva in the library to the interface and sign it.
